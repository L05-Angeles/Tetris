# Tetris

This is my first attempt at creating a Tetris clone. 
The game is simple, you are given a falling block and you need to use the arrow keys:
down left right
to translate the block across the grid.
The up arrow key is reserved for rotating the shape block.

While the game is playable, I still need to implement the following features:
- a space and function to hold a piece for future usage
- a randomizer that generates a permutation of the 7 shapes and returns it as a list of next shapes
- mechanic to let the player hold down a direction key to move the block faster
- a mechanic to fast drop the shape
